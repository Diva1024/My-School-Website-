           <h1>Chess Class</h1>
    <img src="CHESS.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p>Udgam School is one of the very few schools in the country which can boast about an International Grand Master in its Alumni. Tejas Bakre is the 12th Grand Master from India and Udgam is proud to be his Alma Mater. Manthan Choksi and Fenil Shah are two other state level champions from the school.A number of studies in the West have shown that playing chess aids not only the early development of the brain but also benefits young players socially, builds character and contributes to overall classroom performance. At the 40th World Chess Congress in 1969, Dr. Hans Klaus, Dean of the School of Philosophy at Humboldt University in Berlin, commented upon the chess studies completed in Germany: “Chess helps any human being to elaborate exact methods of thinking. It would be particularly useful to start playing chess from the early school days”.
Chess is a compulsory activity for the standards 5th, 6th and 7th. Udgam School doesn’t charge anything extra for this activity and the coaching is done during school hours. Cumulatively 360 students are trained for Chess at our school.</p>

           <h1>Yoga Class</h1>
    <img src="YOGA.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
        <p>Yoga is beneficial for the body and soul. Regular practice of this exercise makes the body flexible and generates mental peace in a person. Today, It is accepted worldwide as one of the most effective forms of exercise to influence physical as well as psychological balance.At Udgam, we understand the importance of yoga, thus host weekly classes for the students. It is a compulsory activity at Udgam School, and there are no extra charges. A team of qualified yoga trainers imparts basic yoga knowledge to our students. CBSE isssues guidelines of incorporating yoga in school education in 2015, however Udgam School has incorporated since 1996. Having a dedicated yoga room, an allotted time in the time table, yoga curriculum and experienced faculty, we take yoga training seriously.</p>
